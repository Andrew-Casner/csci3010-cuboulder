Programming Exercise 1 (`Point`)
==================

For this exercise, you should turn in four files on moodle:

`point.cc` or `point.cpp` (should include function comments)

`point.h`

`main.cc` or `main.cpp` (should include file comment)

`Makefile`

Your `Point` class will define a 3 dimensional point (a point with an x, y, and z coordinate). It should have getter methods for each coordinate and a method, `Distance`, to calculate the euclidian distance between this `Point` and another.

Your main function should create at least two points, calculate the distance between them, and report their coordinates and the calculated distance to the user.

Refer to the style [guidelines](../concise_style_guide_cpp.md). To receive full credit for this assignment, your code must be commented and must compile on the CS VM.
