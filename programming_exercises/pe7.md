PE 7 
==============

1. Clean up all branches and pull requests in the course collaboration [repository](https://github.com/muzny/csci3010-fall2018-collab).

2. Install [QtCreator](). Warning: this software does take a significant amount of space on your machine. You can uninstall it at the end of the semester, but we will be using it for the rest of the course.
