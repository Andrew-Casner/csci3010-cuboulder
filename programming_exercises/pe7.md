PE 7 (collab repo clean up + Qt installation)
==============

1. Clean up all branches and pull requests in the course collaboration [repository](https://github.com/muzny/csci3010-fall2018-collab).
- This may require responding to reviews/making changes.
- This may require submitting new pull requests for branches that you have laying around.
- When your PRs are approved, you should fix any merge conflicts, merge your branch into master, then delete your branch.

2. Install [QtCreator](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/gettingstarted.html). We'll be using Qt version 5.x. Warning: this software does take a significant amount of space on your machine. You can uninstall it at the end of the semester, but we will be using it for the rest of the course.
- Here is a [Qt for beginners wiki that you may find useful](https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_for_Beginners)
- Please post any Qt Installation questions on piazza with screenshots so that Kyle and I can help you out (or come to office hours).

3. Do the [text finder](http://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/creator-writing-program.html) tutorial.

__To turn in__:
- 1 screenshot of your installed version of Qt Creator running the TextFinder tutorial.
- 2 a text file in which you answer the following questions: in Qt, what is a signal? what is a slot? Where are they used in the TextFinder tutorial? (Feel free to [read the Qt documentation about signals and slots](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/signalsandslots.html))
