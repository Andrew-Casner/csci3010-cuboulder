PE 6 (git, inheritance)
==============

(To be done in groups of 2 or 3 (__required__).)

1. Create a new github repository for your group. (Person 1)
2. Make sure that someone went through the repo initialization steps before you attempt to create a branch. (Person 2)

__To receive credit__: submit a link to your github to the assignment on moodle.

Person 1
------
1. Get the branch that Person 2 created locally.
2. Add the [provided](../lectures/9_inheritance_part1/animals/) files to your branch and push these changes to remote. (You don't need to add the provided `main.cpp`, but don't worry about it if you already did.)
3. Connect your repo to Travis CI. When new code is pushed to any branch in your repo, your code should be compiled. (Take a look at the `.travis.yml` file in the course collaboration repo for inspiration).
-- (do not go on until all group members have completed their first three steps) --  
-- (merge the branch into master) --
4. Create a new branch just for yourself.
5. Implement one new Animal in the files `Animal.h` and `Animal.cpp`. Make sure to instantiate it in your `main.cpp`.
6. Create a PR with your teammates as reviewers.
7. Once the PR has been approved by your team members, merge your branch into master.


Person 2
------
1. Create a new branch in your repository.
2. Create an empty `main.cpp` and push this to your remote branch.
3. Write a Makefile, then push these changes to remote.   
-- (do not go on until all group members have completed their first three steps) --
4. Create a new branch just for yourself.
5. Implement one new Animal in the files `Animal.h` and `Animal.cpp`. Make sure to instantiate it in your `main.cpp`.
6. Create a PR with your teammates as reviewers.
7. Once the PR has been approved by your team members, merge your branch into master.



Person 3 (if they exist in your group)
------
1. Get the branch that Person 2 created locally.
2. Add a README.md to your repository with your group members names and their roles, then push these changes to remote.
3. Add an icon to your README.md indicating the build status of your repository.
