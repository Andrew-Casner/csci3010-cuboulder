Expectations
--------
You are expected to come to class and actively participate in group and individual work. You are expected to treat your fellow classmates with respect, and work with them to create an environment in which students are comfortable sharing knowledge with and teaching one another.

Late Policy
-------
All homeworks may be turned in up to 3 days (72 hours) late for a 20% penalty. If a homework is due on Wednesday at 11:55pm, it may be turned in as late as Saturday at 11:55pm. If a student would have received a 95% had they turned their homework in on time, a late submission will earn them a 75% instead.

In class activities must be completed in class.

Programming exercises may not be turned in late.

Make-Up Policy
-------
If you are unable to class on a particular day, it is your responsibility to contact the instructor beforehand. If you contact the instructor at least 48 hours in advance, it may be possible for you to make-up the work for ½ credit. Other extensions will only be given in cases of medical and family emergencies.

Collaboration Policy
----------
You are expected to do your work yourself or with your partner when indicated.

The collaboration policy is simple:
*__Inspiration is free__: you may discuss homework assignments with anyone. You are especially encouraged to discuss strategies with your instructor, your TAs, and your classmates. “Discuss” does not mean “copy” or “show me your homework”.
*__Plagiarism is forbidden__: assignments and code that you turn in should be written entirely on your own. You should not need to consult sources beyond your textbook, class notes, posted lecture slides and notebooks, and Python/Matplotlib documentation. Copying/soliciting a solution to a problem from the internet or another classmate constitutes a violation of the course's collaboration policy and the honor code and will result in a trip to the honor council, loss of credit for the assignment, and a grade reduction.
*__Do not search for a solution online__: You may not actively search for a solution to the problem from the internet. This includes posting to sources like StackExchange, Reddit, Chegg, etc.
*__StackExchange Clarification__: Searching for basic techniques in Python is totally fine. If you want to post and ask "How do convert a float to an integer" that's fine. What you cannot do is post "Here's the function my prof gave me to write. I need to convert this temperature in celcius to farenheit. Give me code!". That's cheating.
*__Tutors__: you should always consult piazza, the CA, and the instructor for this course if you need extra help. They are here specifically to help you! You should never have anyone else write code for you. This includes tutors, friends, strangers, friends of friends. Anyone who is not you. You can review concepts with tutors, just not specific homework problems.
*__When in doubt, ask__: If you have doubts about this policy or would like to discuss specific cases, please ask the instructor.
